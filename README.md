# kotlin-project-template
Project Template for convenient project setup.

## Motivation
Every time I create a new project, I do a lot of routine work, so this repo should decrease amount of this work.

## Initializing
- `setting.gradle.kts`: Set your root project name
- `buildUtils/dependencies/AppInfo.kt`: Set your package
- `build.gradle.kts`: Setup your root build.gradle.kts with configurations
